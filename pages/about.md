## About this exhibition

This exhibition was generated from a Trove List using [this Jupyter notebook](http://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#convert-a-trove-list-into-a-collectionbuilder-exhibition) in the GLAM Workbench. The notebook converts [Trove lists](https://trove.nla.gov.au/help/become-voluntrove/lists) into a series of files that can be uploaded to a [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh) repository to create an instant exhibition.

See the [CollectionBuilder site](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) for more information on how CollectionBuilder works and what it can do.
